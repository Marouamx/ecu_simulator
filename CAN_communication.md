## CAN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN 2 STM32F4 CHIPS

Establish a CAN communication between 2 discovery boards (STM32F4) 

Both boards will be transmitter and receiver so same circuit, configuration and approximately same code will be applied to both.

For the circuit I am using the STM32F4 discovery shield
